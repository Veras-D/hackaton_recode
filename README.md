## 📌 Project Overview

Alô Comunidade is a responsive website designed to centralize **critical information during flood emergencies**. It aims to bridge the gap between **those in need** and **available shelters**, by providing updated data on shelter locations, accessibility conditions, and capacities.

> 🚨 Floods are frequent in southern Brazil. Lack of information during crises worsens the impact. Our platform helps reduce that gap.
